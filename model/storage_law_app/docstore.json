For the sake of completeness, the Federation enacted the\nGIDC (Amendment) Act, 2018. Under this Act the CNG sector was\npermitted to pay half of the cess levied or charged from 01-01-2012\nto 01-05-2015 in two tranches after signing agreements with the\nGas Distribution Companies. A number of CNG stations made\npayments under the GIDC (Amendment) Act, 2018.\nGIDC (Amendment) Act, 2018\nis attached as Annex O\n33. That through the impingement bills SSGC has raised an illegal\ndemand of arrears of cess against the plaintiffs.\nSample Bills for the months of November & December. 2020\nare attached as Annex P\nDemand of arrears of cess is against the judgment and decree of\nthis Hon\u2019ble Court.\n34. That the majority judgment in Khurshid Soap did not sect-aside\neither the judgment or the decrees of this Hon\u2019ble Court. The\njudgment and decrees in the Plaintiff\u2019s suit are still in field and\ncontinue to operate. The defendants are, therefore, estopped from\nraising any demand of cess against the plaintiffs. As the judgment\nand decrees passed by this Hon\u2019ble Court continue to hold the field\nthe demand of arrears of cess from the plaintiffs is illegal.\n35. Without prejudice, this Hon\u2019ble Court has held already declared\nthe demand of GIDC from the Plaintiffs illegal. The plaintiffs\u2019 rights\nstand conclusively determined. Those rights are not affected by a\ncontrary view taken by the majority judgment in Khurshid Soap.\nThis is the law declared by the judgment of a Larger Bench of SCP\nreported as Pir Bakhsh & Others v. Chairman Allotment\nCommittee; PLD 1987 SC 145 (Pir Bukhsh).\nPir Bukhsh & others v. Chairman Allotment Committee;\nPLD 1987 SC 145 is attached as Annex Q\n36. The judgment in Pir Bukhsh was delivered by a 4- Member\nBench of the SCP, whereas, the majority judgment in Khrushid\nSoap is by 2 Hon\u2019ble Judges of SCP. It is settled law that in case\nof conflict of opinion in judgments of SCP the High Courts are\nbound to follow the law declared by a larger Bench. To the extent\nthat the two judgments conflict the judgment in Khurshid Soap is\nper incuriam.\n37. Without prejudice, once the Plaintiffs\u2019 suit was decreed and\nGIDC Act, 2015 declared unconstitutional no GIDC could be levied\nor charged by the Federation from the Plaintiffs.

Section 8 of the GIDC Act, 2015 reads as under: -\n\u201c8. Validation of cess collected. \u2013(1) Notwithstanding\nany omission or anything to the contrary contained in the\nGas Infrastructure Development Cess Act, 2011 (XXI of\n2011) or the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess\nOrdinance, 2014 (VI of 2014) or the rules made\nthereunder, or anything to the contrary contained in any\ndecree, judgment or order of any Court, the cess levied,\ncharged, colle3cted or realized by the company from gas\nconsumers under the aforesaid Act or Ordinance shall be\ndeemed to have been validly levied, charged, collected\nor realized under the provisions of this Act.\n(2) Where any cess referred to in sub-section (1) has\nnot been paid or realized before the coming into\nforce of this Act or if so paid or realized, has been\nrefunded or adjusted against other fees or taxes or\ncharges payable by the gas consumers or the\ncompany, the same shall be recoverable in\naccordance with the provisions of this Act:\nProvided that the said Cess shall not be\ncollected from industrial sector excluding Fertilizer\nFeed Stock, mentioned at S.No.3 of the second\nSchedule to both the Gas Infrastructure\nDevelopment Cess Act, 2011 (XXI of 2011) and\nthe Gas Infrastructure Development Cess\nOrdinance, 2014 (VI of 2014), if it has not been\ncollected by it.\n39. It is submitted in the alternative that the Plaintiffs are being\nunlawfully denied the benefits of sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the\nGIDC Act, 2015. The CNG sector is an industrial sector. Natural\ngas is compressed by CNG stations through an industrial process.\nThe CNG sector is charged industrial tariff both for natural gas and\nelectricity throughout the country. The categories provided in the\nsecond Schedule of the GIDC Act, 2011 and the Ordinance were\nonly for purposes of rates at which the cess was to be charged and\ncollected from the consumers of natural gas. However, no such\ncategorization is provided in sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the\nGIDC Act, 2015. Only Fertilizer Fuel Stock has been excluded. The\nterm \u201cindustrial sector\u201d in proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 8 of\nthe GIDC Act, 2015 includes the CNG Sector. Any other\ninterpretation of this provision would not only tantamount to\nreading into the provision but will render it ex facie discriminatory\nand repugnant to Article 25 of the Constitution.\n40. The Plaintiffs did not charge or collect GIDC from their\nconsumers. They did not pass on the burden. The plaintiffs are,\ntherefore, entitled to the benefit of sub-section (2) of Section 8 of\nthe GIDC Act, 2015.\n41.

The CNG sector is de-regulated. This is evident from the\ndecision of the ECC dated 13-12-2016. Each CNG station\ndetermines its own sale price. From the date of judgment and\ndecree of this Hon\u2019ble Court GIDC could neither be charged nor\nlevied or collected from the plaintiffs\u2019 sale price of CNG. Even\notherwise, including the component of GIDC in the sale price\nrenders CNG uncompetitive in the fuel market. The plaintiffs did\nnot include GIDC in their sale price.\nDecision of the ECC dated 13-12-2016\nis attached as Annex S\n43. As per the majority judgment in Khurshid Soap persons who\npassed on the burden to consumers were required to pay GIDC.\nArrears of cess were also required to be collected from such\npersons. However, since the plaintiffs did not pass the burden to\ntheir consumers the demand of arrears from the plaintiffs is illegal\nand against the majority judgment in Khurshid Soap.\nSCP misled by the Federal Government\n44. Without prejudice, the majority judgment in Khurshid Soap\nrelied on the following representations of the Federal Government:\n(i) That the amount collected as GIDC was available in its\naccounts. Those funds were kept in a separate account; and\n(ii) that the GIDC shall be utilized for laying of the North-South\npipeline, which was purportedly an \u201cancillary project\u201d under\nsub-section (1) of Section 4 of the GIDC Act, 2015.\nThe majority judgment upheld the validity of the GIDC Act, 2015 on\nthe basis of these representations of the Federal Government,\nCollection and utilization of cess for lying of the North-South Pipeline\nwas also allowed on this basis.\n45. It is respectfully submitted that both the above statements of the\nFederal Government are false. In a recent debate, which haired on\nnational television on 18-12-2020, the incumbent Special Assistant\nto the Prime Minister on Energy, Mr Nadeem Babar (SAPM) stated\nthat the total GIDC collected was no more available in the accounts\nof the Federal Government. He categorically stated that a majority\nof the amount collected as GIDC was utilized for other purposes by\nthe previous government.\n46. Further, in the same televised debate the former Minister for\nEnergy, Mr Shahid Khaqan Abbasi categorically stated that the\nNorth-South pipeline was not a project for which GIDC was to be\nutilized. That this project was commercial in nature and was to be\nundertake by the Gas Distribution Companies from their own\nresources. That the Gas Distribution Companies would earn\nrevenue from this project once it is completed.\n47. The only inference to be drawn from the above statements of\nthe SAPM and the former Minister of Energy is that the Federal\nGovernment misled the SCP with false representations regarding\nthe availability and utilization of GIDC. The majority judgment of\nSCP was, therefore, obtained by the Federal Government through\nmisrepresentation.\n48. It has also recently been reported in the newspapers that the\nFederal Government has allowed the Petroleum Division to utilize\nfunds from GIDC from repayment of loan of Government Holdings\n(Pvt.) Limited (GHPL). Such utilization of GIDC is repugnant to\nSection 4 of the GIDC Act, 2015 and in contravention of the\njudgment of the SCP in Khurshid Soap.\nNewspaper clipping is attached Annex T\n49.

It is common knowledge that due to shortage of gas supply\nCNG stations across the country are being allowed to operate only\n1-2 days a week. The revenue of CBG stations is at an all time\nlow. The plaintiffs are not in a financial position to pay the arrears\nof cess, as unlawfully demanded by SSGC. If they are compelled\nto pay, they will go into liquidation. The plaintiffs, in view of the\njudgment and decree of this Hon\u2019ble Court, did not collect GIDC\nfrom their consumers. The burden to pay the arrears of cess,\nhowever, now falls on the plaintiffs. As per judgment of SCP in\nKhurshid Soap the burden of GIDC is to be borne by the domestic\nconsumers. The plaintiffs, therefore, cannot be compelled to bear\nthis burden.\n50. Without prejudice to the above, through the impugned bills\nwithholding tax @ 4% is being charged on the amount calculated\nas GIDC. It is respectfully submitted that the demand of withholding\ntax is illegal. Withholding tax is payable on the income of a person.\nGIDC is not income of the Plaintiffs. It is therefore not liable to be\ntaxed as such.\n51. In view of the above, the demand and collection of arrears of\ncess from the plaintiffs is illegal.\n52.

That , the is an edified, educated, respectable and\nlaw abiding citizen of Islamic Republic of Pakistan\nand is living at the above said address along with his\nfamily and further engaged in lawful business at\nbelow mentioned shop as such enjoys good\nreputation among business community as well as\ngeneral public.\n2. That the proposed accused is the sole and absolute\nOwner of Shop bearing, on ground floor, in the\nbuilding k, Karachi, equipped with all necessary\nfittings and fixtures hereinafter referred to\nPREMISES.\n3. That the applicant approached the proposed accused\nto let out the above said premises as such both the\nparties agreed upon to let out the same vide\nagreement of Tenancy dated 2014 on a monthly rent\nof Rs. Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only)\nwhich shall be paid by the applicant to the proposed\naccused, month to month in advance on or before 5th\nday of each English Calendar month positively and\nfurther the applicant also paid an amount of\nRs.3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lac Only) being the\nSecurity Deposit. The said tenancy was for a term of\nthree years and the same was extendable by mutual\nconsent of both the parties and the same was\nenhanced from time to time and at present the\napplicant is paid rent at the rate of\nRs._____________ per month.\n(Copies of Tenancy Agreement and few rent\nreceipts are filed herewith and marked as\nannexure A/1 to A/ )\n4. That , it is averred that admittedly the applicant has\nnot defaulted in payment of monthly rent and has\nbeen paying the rent regularly. It is clarified that\nhaving a friendly relation with the proposed accused,\nthe applicant is paying rent and no receipt is being\nissued, which is an undisputed fact.\n5. That , due to the well skilled in his profession , the\napplicant has earned good name among the business\ncommunity and locality and earning his livelihood for\nhis family members and is paying the rent regularly\nto the proposed accused in respect of above said\nrented premises and no rent is outstanding against\nthe applicant and he has never defaulted in payment\nof monthly rent to the proposed accused.\n6. That when the applicant took the shop on rent, it was\nin a dilapidated condition. The applicant spent three\nyears like that. In 2017, when the applicant signed\nthe contract again, he signed a new contract with the\nowner / proposed accused and asked him to do the\nrenovation of the shop. The proposed accused of the\nshop told the applicant that he don't have enough\nmoney to do the renovation of this shop, so if the\napplicant do the renovation of this shop, the\nproposed accused would make a 10-year contract\nwith the applicant and would not vacate the shop for\n10 years. Admitting this, the applicant spent 20 to 25\nlakh rupees on the occasion. After that the lockdown\ncame and the applicant had to close the shop but still\nthe applicant was paying the monthly rent as per the\ncontract along with the annual increase. Due to the\nlockdown, the applicant became a debtor of 15 to 20\nlakhs and the applicant is demanding rent which is\nillegal according to the contract.\n7. That according to the contract the rent was\nincreased by 10% every year but the proposed\naccused tried to demand this from the applicant\nillegally with increased rent.

That earlier when the applicant did not appear before learned trial\ncourt, section 87-88 was conducted but no proceeding under section 514\nCr PC was carried out and surety was not forfeited as such the bail of\napplicant was intact and on the said bail, the applicant joined the trial and\nthe said warrant of arrest issued under section 87-88 has been finished\nand no surety was forfeited , and when the applicant joined the trial, the\nlearned trial court issued show cause notice and cancelled the bail of the\napplicant granted by District and Session Judge Central without sending\nany intimation to the honorable court as the learned trial court has no\nauthority to cancel the said bail under section 497(5) Cr.P.C, the learned\ntrial court was required to transfer letter to Session Court and the\nHonorable District & Session Court may cancel the bail. The learned trial\ncourt can only call surety from the Session Court, but instead of sending\nintimation and calling of surety from the Session Court, cancelled the bail\ngranted by the Session Judge at Karachi Central in presence of accused\nand called surety , as such the said act of the learned trial court for\npassing impugned is illegal and unlawful and liable to be set aside and\nfurther allow the applicant to join the trial of the case.\n(Copy of Warrant of 87-88 is annexed herewith and marked as\nannexure A/ )\n14.

That applicant/accused has filed bail application before Learned\nDistrict and Sessions Judge at Karachi West, which was\ntransferred to the Learned 1st Additional District and Sessions\nJudge West Karachi being bail application No.which was\ndismissed by the learned trial court vide order dated 2023.\n3.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 120870, "end_char_idx": 124247, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22cc4a34-b1a8-443b-ab34-2daa376766b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "22cc4a34-b1a8-443b-ab34-2daa376766b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f6b15c4-2f00-419f-bc89-3075408754d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1bb005f3320d2a94592a202f466e9d6e59fa23aff7876e825bfbe701c6b3dbf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea712d5b-4cd7-491b-b26f-94e4b75bc755", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c765138e79fba5409b6739b12fc536139007fb73d6fb553fce977c152c36c940", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80e37442-1c4d-4883-924a-8b634b7b28a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fcd0529f42149d1dbe773faaeb0d3ae0661c1948d8431456671880383d1cbf4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SIU Karachi, hence the accused was arrested, the recovered\nCharas has been separately sealed and stamped on spot, and the\naccused after thoroughly searched were taken into custody\nthrough Fard , which was prepared at the spot, after return to\npolice station, the instant case against Accused AKM son ofAUR\nis made out, as per direction of highup, the investigation shall be\ncarried out by SI MW posted at this police station, and FIR will\nbe distributed as per procedure.\n2. That applicant/accused has filed bail application before Learned\nDistrict and Sessions Judge at Karachi West, which was\ntransferred to the Learned 1st Additional District and Sessions\nJudge West Karachi being bail application No.which was\ndismissed by the learned trial court vide order dated 2023.\n3. That after completion of initial investigation, the charge\nsheet/Challan was submitted by the prosecution against the\naccused, after completion of further legal formalities, the case\nwas transferred to Learned Trial Court/Ist Additional District\nSessions Judge Karachi West, for trial.\nThe certified Photocopy of Challan and\nChemical Examination report are annexed and\nmarked as \u2018\u2019D & D/1\u2019\u2019).\n4. That after passing considerable period of 6 month period) the 1st\nbail application was moved before Learned Trial Court on behalf\nof the accused, mainly on hardship ground of applicant/accused\nand lack of interest on the part of prosecution to conclude the\ntrial, which was also dismissed vide Order dated 2023. hence this\nsecond bail application on the following fresh grounds: -\nGROUNDS\n1. That the applicant/ accused is innocent and falsely implicated in\nthis case with malafide intention and has committed no offence.\n2. That there is nothing recovered from the possession of applicant\n/ accused, and the alleged recovery has been foisted upon the\napplicant / accused by the prosecution due to non-fulfillment of\nbribe money.\n3. That another co-accused namely Habib ur Rehman alias Mama\nson of Hassan Shah who was arrested along with the present\napplicant/accused and joint memo of arrest and recovery was\nprepared by the concerned police, later on two separate FIRs FIR\nNo. abd FIR No, U/S 9(1)3(c) Control of Narcotics Act 2022 at\nPS SIU, have been lodged of same incident and quantity i.e;\n1600gram , and the co-accused namely Habib ur Rehman alias\nMama who has been granted bail by this Honorable Court vide\norder dated2023 in Bail Application No. in the sum of\nRs.50,000/- as such Rule of Consistency is fully applicable in the\ncase of present accused and he is entitled for bail as a matter of\nlegal right.\n4. That the prosecution miserably failed to cite any private witness\nfor the purpose of search and recovery of alleged charas, as the\narea is very thickly populated, and case needs further inquiry.\n5. That the alleged recovery of 1600 grams of Charas from the\npossession of applicant is highly doubtful as there is no tangible\nevidence available for prosecution to prove the same in such\ncircumstances, hence the case is doubtful and needs further\ninquiry.\n6. That the alleged incident took placed at 0015 hours and the police\nofficials made the entries in the police station when they\nreturned, so mentioned the time as 0230 hours and the same time\nmentioned in the FIR according to the incident at 0015 hours\nwhich is a serious contradiction and creates doubt in this case.\n7. That the prosecution totally failed, not to mention in the FIR\nChallan and arrest memo and in their statement witnesses under\nsection 161 Cr.P.C that the charas was sent to the chemical\nExaminer which is violation of law.\n8. That the prosecution failed to show any purchaser of alleged\nCharas, which fact creates doubts and case needs further inquiry.\n9.

That so far no charge has been framed from the date of\ncommencement of trail and only copies were supplied to the\naccused so far and since then the accused is being kept behind\nthe bar un-justifiedly.\n11. That there is no any criminal case pending against accused\nexcept the present one and he never remained involved in any\ncriminal case.\n12.

That the applicant falsely stated in the above case that she was not\npaid dower amount, whereas the respondent had paid the dower\namount of the applicant at the time of Nikah in the form of 7\nbangles of gold on the day of wedding. It is further submitted that\nsince the day the spouses got married she kept her all gold\nbelonging at her mother\u2019s house, also the gold which was given to\nher by respondent from and my family and other gold which was\nmade by saving day by day more for their daughters\u2019 future worth\nRupees 4 Million till to date is also in the custody of the applicant\nand she has concealed this facts from this Honorable Court and\ndespite of repeated demands by respondent to the\nplaintiff/applicant No.1 to return the same, she has failed and\nneglected to return the same and has illegally and unlawfully\nretained the said gold in her possession.

That the applicant without consent and permission of the\nrespondent left his house in the month of 2020 and since then she\ndid not turn up. That the day she left the house on 1st March, 2020,\nshe took everything with her, more than 8 bags full jewelry, clothes,\nmake up, shoes. Whereas it is vehemently denied that the\nrespondent left her at her parent house and kept the minors with\nhimself. It is submitted that if she was seriously ill, she would have\nsubmit medical reports / prescriptions from authentic/reputable\nhospital before this Honorable Court as for her all medical issues\nthe both spouses used to go to Aga Khan Hospital for medical\ntreatment. As mentioned in divorce papers she didn\u2019t\ncontacted kids for 2 months, and after that she started calling\ntwice thrice a week, she never bothered for their health,\neducation and mental state. It is pertinent to mention that\nwhen the applicant No.1 left the house, the younger daughter\nwas only 15 months old which is considered to be on mother\nfeed but she refuted from her responsibly.\n12. That in between October, 2020 after almost 9 months first time\nshe came to house of respondent with her father, when the\nrespondent was not at home, they threatened again his mother,\nthen his mother invited her father in the house on which he\nthreatened and said, \u201csee what I will do with you, your son and his\ndaughters\u201d, then the applicant No.1 went inside the house and\ntook all the remaining things which she had kept it locked (which I\nwas not aware of what was inside the locker, as she had the keys)\nand has taken away all the valuable dowry articles including gold\nand nothing is in possession of the respondent. It is further\nsubmitted that even before sending the divorce deed his counsel\ncalled her father, just to make them aware, if they wanted to patch\nup but he was very calm and told him to send the document, and\nwithin hour the respondent got a call from their lawyer and he\nasked respondent to send the divorce deed by courier and the\nrespondent is having call recording as proof in his possession. It is\npertinent to mention that the respondent as mentioned above had\nalready paid the dower amount in the shape of gold ornaments at\nthe time of Nikah and nothing is due against respondent in lieu of\ndower amount. I further state that this was her plan since beginning\nthat she would sell all the gold and will enjoy her life as per her\nwish. Her allegation that she did not let the kids meet, is also false\nas they came 3 times to the house, took kids out of the house and\nset on stairs and told respondent that they would defame\nrespondent everywhere, and met the kids, and made the video\nwhich she also sent to family of respondent that they are sitting\noutside the house and playing with daughters and whole neighbors\nare eye witnessed that his mother decently invited them inside the\nhouse to meet the kids which they refused and created a drama\noutside the house.
